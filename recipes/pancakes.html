                Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof plater
                ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a small bowl, whisk
                together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt; set aside.   
            </li>
            <li>
                In medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and eggs.
                Add dry indgredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened 
                (do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine).
            </li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. 
                Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; 
                carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.
            </li>

            <li>For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, 
                using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round 
                (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 
                1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned 
                on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; 
                cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. Continue with more o
                il and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, 
                with desired toppings.

                    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                    <li>2¼ cups milk</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

             <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
            <li>
                Stir sugar, cream, and milk into a saucepan over low heat 
                until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until mix is hot and 
                a small ring of foam appears around the edge.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large 
                measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, 
                at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, 
                and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece 
                of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in freezer to ripen, 
                2 to 3 hours.                
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        </div>
